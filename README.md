# My Portfolio

Hello There! Welcome to my portfolio page.

Enjoy!


THE CASE:
Build a solid foundation for a successful start into my carreer after 7,5 years of being a student that would stand out from competitors.

SOLVING APPROACH:  
Without any experience in web design and development I started - again - with self-enablement by reading through articles and communites e.g. on medium to identify key requirementes for designing and building my own portfolio experience. Followed by online courses on scrimba and udemy for HTML, CSS, JS and other. Finally, seraching for inspiration e.g. on dribbble and analyzing the code of websites from awarded design experts.

THE RESULT: 
One design for CV documents and my website in addition to new and exciting skillset. Design projects are fun!
